                    <p>Since opening in 1978 Wetterling Gallery has been leading the way for contemporary art in Scandinavia. As well as introducing international artists to the local scene, it has also been championing Swedish artists with a particular focus on the latest trends in painting, sculpture, and photography. Wetterling Gallery hosts around seven exhibitions annually, presenting the works of both well-established and emerging talent. World-famous individuals, such as Pop Art exponent James Rosenquist, have had recent shows here. The gallery’s founder, Björn Wetterling, has chaired The Swedish Gallery Association since 2010, and the gallery has been actively involved in the international art scene, participating in around four major fairs per year.

                        The Art Nouveau building containing Fotografiska, formerly an old customs house, was designed by acclaimed Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg. Today, it is home to one of the best photography museums in Scandinavia. Every year the museum stages between 15 and 20 major exhibitions, which have presented internationally renowned photographers, including Swedes Helena Blomqvist and Klara Källström. Photography shows at Fotografiska explore many different themes, such as Roger Ballen’s black and white depictions of human or animal absurdity, and Sebastião Salgado’s images of parts of the world that have escaped modern civilization. Visitors to Fotografiska can also enjoy after-hours music events and excellent views of Stockholm from its dining spaces.

                    In Tyresta National Park just 2 km outside of Stockholm, you’ll find something as rare as real old-growth forest. For hundreds of years, the wood has grown and thrived without being affected by humans. Here you can enjoy ancient pine trees, lakes, and rocks that have been polished by the land-base ice. And a variety of animals like capercailzies and long-horned beetles.
                    <br>
                    An excellent way to start the wilderness adventure is by visiting Tyresta village in Haninge. Here you’ll find a visitor center: Naturum The National Parks’ house where you can buy maps. There are also a café, a bird tower, and adventure paths for children. From Tyresta village, there are several different hiking trails adapted to different needs and conditions. Along the hiking trails, there are cozy resting places with fireplaces where you can relax and grill your food.
                    <br>
                    If you’re a fan of history, it’s recommended to enter Tyresta National Park from the entrance in Nyfors in the northern part of the nature reserve. Here you can see the ruins of long-abandoned industries.
