                        <p>the 3rd of March 2019. That date marked the day when two happy chaps named Johan Evers and
                            Oscar
                            Drigoris entered what used to be a small café – with sledge hammers and wall paint in their
                            hands, butterflies at heart, and a pretty darn crystal clear vision in mind.

                            your heart to skip a beat. They’ve been nourishing their concept, roasting a hell of a lot
                            of
                            garnish, merging unexpected (yet irresistible) flavours and having the occasional (ok let’s

                            For over 10 years, we have delighted Stockholm and created a wider and deeper understanding
                            for authentic Japanese cooking, but there is still so much to show, cook and experience. We
                            fight a daily battle against misunderstandings and prejudices about Japanese cuisine. Like,
                            what’s the deal with pouring soy sauce on well made dishes and completely ruin the flavor
                            balance? And well-made sushi pieces swimming in soy sauce… And expecting a bowl of rice bowl
                            or miso soup with any dishes? Just… please don’t. These are customs that have been
                            established in not so authentic Japanese restaurants over the years with no harm intended,
                            but now it’s time to eat Japanese in a true Japanese way. I promise you, it will be worth
                            it.
                            I’m proud to announce the next step in our quest to serve you the best possible Japanese
                            food experience:
                        </p>
