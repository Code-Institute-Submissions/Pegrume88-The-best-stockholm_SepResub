                    <p>the 3rd of March 2019. That date marked the day when two happy chaps named Johan Evers and Oscar
                        Drigoris entered what used to be a small café – with sledge hammers and wall paint in their
                        hands, butterflies at heart, and a pretty darn crystal clear vision in mind.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        these happy chaps been working hard to make your senses do hula hoops, your tongue swirl and
                        your heart to skip a beat. They’ve been nourishing their concept, roasting a hell of a lot of
                        garnish, merging unexpected (yet irresistible) flavours and having the occasional (ok let’s be
                        honest, pretty recurrent) dance behind the bar.

                <p>Wood stockholm Bistro is a place where flavours and meetings are created without regard to
                    traditional boundaries. It is a place where we want everyone to feel welcome and be able to enjoy
                    locally and sustainably produced food and drinks in a warm and beautiful environment. Chef Elias and
                    his team work with a dynamic menu that changes regularly.
                    Tables, chairs, lamps and artistic installations are all part of the experience we want to offer.
